# Bakery

This is the website for a bakery store.

It's not really a bakery store...

# Run Instructions

If you want to run this locally, a good option is through VSCode + a browser.  You need to install the extension called "Live Server" inside VSCode.  Once installed, right click on the html file and choose "Open with Live Server
" and it should open in your default browser.
